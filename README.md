# dotfiles

> Set up a new Mac super quick! :sunglasses:


### Please note:
If youâ€™re not me, you wonâ€™t want [`.gitconfig`](https://github.com/furzeface/dotfiles/blob/master/.gitconfig) to have my details, or [`.npm.sh`](https://github.com/furzeface/dotfiles/blob/master/.npm.sh#L9) to add me as a user.

You also probably donâ€˜t want all my GitHub repos from [`.gitrepos.sh`](https://github.com/furzeface/dotfiles/blob/master/.gitrepos.sh#L14), so change that too.

I suggest you [fork this repository](https://github.com/furzeface/dotfiles/fork) and amend these scripts accordingly, as well as adding anything extra you need and removing anything in particular you hate. :+1:

## Turn Mac on
ðŸ•¹

## Backup any current dotfiles
```sh
cd; curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/furzeface/dotfiles/master/.backup.sh > .backup.sh && bash .backup.sh
```
Just to be safe&hellip;

## Install these files
```sh
cd; curl -#L https://github.com/furzeface/dotfiles/tarball/master | tar -xzv --strip-components 1 --exclude=README.md
```

---

### Set sensible OSX defaults
```sh
bash .osx.sh
```
**This gets rid of a load of defaults, sets other things. You may need to restart.**

### Install [zsh](http://ohmyz.sh)
```sh
bash .zsh.sh
```
**Immediately start using it instead of the standard shell. Remember to add things from `.aliases` to `~/.zshrc`, or find a way to automate this.**

---

### Install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh) then use it to install [Git](http://git-scm.com), [Node](http://nodejs.org) and [Brew Cask](http://caskroom.io)
```sh
bash .brew.sh
```

**Now take a break, grab a drink, then [set up SSH keys](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account/).**

---

### Install core productivity apps, dev tools, browsers, helper apps with [Brew Cask](http://caskroom.io)
```sh
bash .cask.sh
```
**Now close Safari and start using Chrome.**

---

### Install global Node modules with [NPM](https://www.npmjs.org)
```sh
bash .npm.sh
```
**Remember to log in as yourself, if youâ€™re not me.**

---

### Create my standard set of directories
```sh
bash .mkdir.sh
```

### Clone some of my GitHub repositories
```sh
bash .gitrepos.sh
```
**Remember to change me to you, if you want.**

### Cleanup after yourself, a bit
```sh
bash .cleanup.sh
```

### Disclaimer
This is my _fairly opinionated, specific way_ of setting up Macs for myself. Use it if you want but donâ€™t blame me if anything goes wrong :sunglasses:
